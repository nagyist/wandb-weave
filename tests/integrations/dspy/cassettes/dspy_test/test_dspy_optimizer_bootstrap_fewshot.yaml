      ## ]]\nHow would a typical person answer each of the following questions about
      causation?\nLong ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working
      for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line
      for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice
      between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division,
      which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division.
      John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division,
      but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally
      decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last
      30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division.
      After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building
      with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John
      was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics
      division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed
      to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his
      life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and
      incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists,
      all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John''s cancer was untreatable
      and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated
      no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine
      medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication
      to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and
      experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate

      ## ]]\nHow would a typical person answer each of the following questions about
      causation?\nLong ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working
      for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line
      for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice
      between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division,
      which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division.
      John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division,
      but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally
      decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last
      30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division.
      After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building
      with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John
      was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics
      division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed
      to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his
      life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and
      incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists,
      all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John''s cancer was untreatable
      and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated
      no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine
      medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication
      to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and
      experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate
      him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John''s job
