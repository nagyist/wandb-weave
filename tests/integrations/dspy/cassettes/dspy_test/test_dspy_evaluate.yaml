      ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing
      company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after
      a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions.
      He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working.
      Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because
      he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth
      trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division
      and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production
      line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics
      division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through
      the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic
      substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part
      in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John
      has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle,
      he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50.
      John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that,
      except for pain, John''s cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain
      to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday,

      accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to
